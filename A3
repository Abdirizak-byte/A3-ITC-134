Bobby Will had always loved sleepy Seattle with its old, odd oceans. It was a place where he felt stable. He was a stable, friendly, squash drinker with wobbly moles and ample eyelashes. His friends saw him as a bright, broad bear. Once, he had even helped a dusty kitten recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of man he was. Bobby walked over to the window and reflected on his picturesque surroundings. The wind blew like walking kittens. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Joe Wall. Joe was a smelly volcano with wide moles and ruddy eyelashes. Bobby gulped. He was not prepared for Joe. As Bobby stepped outside and Joe came closer, he could see the tiny glint in his eye. Joe glared with all the wrath of 7261 energetic breezy bears. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want revenge."
